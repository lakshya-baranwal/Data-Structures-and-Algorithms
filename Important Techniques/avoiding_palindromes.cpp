// It is sufficient to choose three distinct integers x, y, and z and repeat them cyclically to avoid forming palindromes.
// This works because at the core of all long palindromes, there is always a smaller palindrome of length two (even) or three (odd).
// And it is mathematically impossible to avoid length one palindromes (single element).
