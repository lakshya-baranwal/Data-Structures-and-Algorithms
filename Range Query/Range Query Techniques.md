### Range Query Techniques Summary

#### ▸ Sqrt Decomposition  
Breaks the array into √n-sized blocks for efficient O(√n) queries and updates.

#### ▸ Segment Tree  
Dynamic structure for range queries and updates in O(log n).

#### ▸ Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)  
Simple to build, used for prefix sums and point updates in O(log n).

#### ▸ Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation  
Extends segment tree to handle range updates efficiently.

#### ▸ Sparse Table  
Best for static queries like min/max/GCD with O(1) query time after preprocessing.

#### ▸ Mo's Algorithm  
Offline algorithm for answering complex range queries in O(√n) per query.

#### ▸ Wavelet Tree  
Advanced structure for k-th smallest, frequency, and rank queries in ranges.

#### ▸ Persistent Segment Tree  
Keeps past versions of the segment tree — useful for historical queries.
